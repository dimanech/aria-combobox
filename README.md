# aria-combobox

WAI ARIA AAA implementation of combobox with list autocomplete.

Please see full specs: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#combobox

## Initialization

This basic class is not ready for direct implementation, so your probably need to extend it to implement suggestions fetching.

Please see 2 implementation example of regular autocomplete combobox and search autocomplete combobox, where we have quick links instead of text values.
